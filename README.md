# Abhigyan Majumdar

> I am a PhD student at the University of California Davis, specializing in System Dynamics & Controls. I am working on probabilistic globally linear modeling of nonlinear systems, leveraging Gaussian Process Regression and the Koopman Operator theory. I am also developing stochastic optimal control schemes leveraging said models to improve controller performance in robotics, autonomous driving, vehicle dynamics and more. I am also interested in real-world application  I have extensive experience with real-world control systems development and testing, especially in an automotive setting, having led the Propulsion Supervisor Controller development from concept-to-drivable for the Cadillac LYRIQ, as the Propulsion Controls and Modeling Lead of the EcoCAR UC Davis team for years 1 and 2 of the EcoCAR EV Challenge.

# Projects

## Energy Optimal dual stage Adaptive Cruive Controller for an Electric Vehicle
- DesignedaNon-linearModelPredictive Controller (NMPC) to optimize energy efficiency and passenger comfort in a longitudinal adaptive cruise controller with varying traffic and lead car dynamics.
- Validated real-time feasibility with MATLABâ€™s fmincon solver, ensuring compliance with energy, comfort, and safety constraints in a model-in-loop (MIL) environment.
 
## Thermal Reduced Order Modeling of an EV Battery Pack
- Workedonreduced-ordermodelingandcoupledelectro-thermalsimulationofLithium-ion battery packs using ANSYS Fluent and TwinBuilder. Established the workflow for system-level simulations that can evaluate different fast charging and thermal control algorithms based on battery performance.

## Autonomous Aerial Landing of a Quadcopter
-  Built a proof-of-concept simulation environment in MATLAB-Simulink for autonomous landing of a UAV on a flying target. Developed an analytical trajectory generation algorithm for producing dynamically feasible, fast target following and landing. Flight stability and reference tracking were achieved through an adaptive LQR controller to handle the non-linear system dynamics.
