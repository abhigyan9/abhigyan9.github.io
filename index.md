Hello! I am Abhigyan Majumdar, a PhD student at the University of California Davis, specializing in System Dynamics & Controls. My work focuses on probabilistic globally linear modeling of nonlinear systems using Gaussian Process Regression and Koopman Operator theory, along with developing stochastic optimal control schemes to enhance controller performance in robotics, autonomous driving, and vehicle dynamics.
